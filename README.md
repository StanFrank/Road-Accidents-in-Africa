# Road-Accidents-in-Africa
##  A Report given on road accidents recorded between the year 1990-2019
As indusrialization began to spread in Africa as a continent after the independence of many countries the automotive industries was one of them.
Like many things the industry had its pros and cons. One of the major disadvantage of the automotive industry was the increased number of accidents. 
In this project I looked at number of deaths and death rates in the African countries through the years, that is from 1990 to 2019 ( This is the data I could get my hands on).
Once you go through the project you will see which countries recorded the highest death rate, which year had the highest death rates, which side of the road has more death rate.
Other descriptive analysis carried in the project are the highest and lowest deaths recorded in a particular country, the year with the highest deaths in a country, deaths per year in each country etc.
I hope the project will relay some insights on the trend of road accidents in the countries and how the problem can be dealt with.
